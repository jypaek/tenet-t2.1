             Tenet-t2.1 (Tenet on tinyos-2.1)
             ================================


1. Intro

    - This code is experimental version under devel.
    - This code is not full port of Tenet. 
      Some optional features are not ported yet.

    - Only tested on telosb motes yet.



2. Pre-requisite

    We assume that you have background knowledge on;
    - TinyOS      : (t1, t2, how to install, env setup, etc)
    - Tenet
      - you should already know about
        - what 'mote' and 'master' are,
        - that tinyos-task and Tenet-task are different,
        - tinyos app. vs. Tenet app. vs. Tenet mote binary.

    You should have;
    - tinyos-2.x     CVS HEAD  (as of Feb.18.2009)

    You should be able to run below ON YOUR OWN;
    - tinyos-2.x/apps/Blink



3. Environment setup

    You should already have proper tinyos-2.x setup;
    - TOSDIR, TOSROOT, MAKERULES.
      (if you don't know what this is, you should not be here)

    In the below instructions, we will assuming that you have 
    the 'tenet-t2.1' code in '/opt/tenet-t2.1/' directory.
    
    You might also want to check section 8.3 once.



4. Instructions on how to run Tenet

   - Follow steps  5, 6, 7



5. Install Tenet mote binary on motes

    Assume you have 3 motes, each connected to
    - mote1:  /dev/ttyUSB0
    - mote2:  /dev/ttyUSB1
    - mote3:  /dev/ttyUSB2

    We will use mote1 as BaseStation, and 
    mote2,3 as the 'Tenet' motes (a.k.a sensor nodes)

       $ cd /opt/tenet-t2.1/mote/apps/BaseStation
       $ make telosb install.1 bsl,/dev/ttyUSB0
       $ cd /opt/tenet-t2.1/mote/apps/Tenet 
       $ make telosb install.2 bsl,/dev/ttyUSB1
       $ make telosb install.3 bsl,/dev/ttyUSB2



6. Run Tenet master stack

       $ cd /opt/tenet-t2.1/master
       $ make
       $ cd /opt/tenet-t2.1/tools/sf
       $ make
       $ cd /opt/tenet-t2.1/tools
       $ ./tenet start -a 1 -c /dev/ttyUSB0 -r 57600 -b lqibase



7. Run Tenet Applications

    Example on how to run Tenet Blink application.

       $ cd /opt/tenet-t2.1/apps
       $ make
       $ cd blink
       $ ./blink
       (Ctrl-C to stop the application)

    You can also run other applications in other directories.



8. Q/A and NOTEs

   8.1. Tenet requires so many steps to run... bad?

     - Well, yes, if you just want to run 
       1 application, once, on one mote.
       For example, Blink on one mote for 10 miutes,
       then TinyOS requires 1 step,
       but Tenet requires 2 + 1 + 1 steps.

       But, if you think about running 
       serveral application, several times, on serveral motes,
       then Tenet takes less steps.
       For example, if you want to run
       Blink, Collect, CntToLeds for 5 miutes each on 20 motes,
       then TinyOS requires 20 * 3  = 60 steps,
       but Tenet requires 21 + 1 + 3 = 25 steps.
