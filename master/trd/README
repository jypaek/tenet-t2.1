If you are using the trd system,
you must access the system using the interfaces defined in "trd_interface.h".
Also, you must implement the functions that are required in "trd_interface.h".

If you are using the trd transport on top of trd_,
you must access the system using the interfaces defined in "trd_transport.h".
Also, you must implement the functions that are required in "trd_transport.h".

Note that in each case, you must call the function 'polling_trd_*'
frequently to poll the trickle timer inside trd timer. (at least every 100ms).
I know this is a pain. But you must!
TRD used to implement it's own internal timer mechanism (itimer), but
this caused problems when SIGNAL's are used in any way.
