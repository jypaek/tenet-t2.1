/**
 * Configuration file for TRD_Timer.

 * TRD_Timer uses the idea from the work:
 *  - "Trickle: A self-regulating algorithm for code maintenance and propagation 
 *     in wireless sensor networks" P. Levis, N. Patel, D. Culler, and S. Shenker. 
 *     In Proceedings of the First USENIX/ACM Symposium on Network Systems Design 
 *     and Implementation (NSDI), 2004.
 * and re-uses some code segments from:
 *  - "Drip" implementation in 'tinyos-1.x/beta/Drip' by Gilman Tolle.
