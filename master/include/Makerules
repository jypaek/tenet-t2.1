# Packet Format
#  - OLD_TOS_MSG_FORMAT will convert CC2420 TOS_Msg format of telosb/micaz/etc
#    into old CC1000 TOS_Msg format when sending packets over the UART.
#  - this conversion is done by mote/lib/FramerM.nc
#  - If undefined, will not to any conversion, and send whatever format 
#    that is used for the radio. (which is different between mica2 and telosb)

# below definition of "BUILDING_PC_SIDE" is used in stargate/task/* files
# they allow the PC-side and mote to share the task contructing functions.

# Maximum TOS_Msg data length
# - This must be set to the value that can be supported by all the motes in the network
#   (76 for micaz, 110 for telosb, and min(76,110) for mixed network)
# - This value will govern the fragmentation of dissemination packet
