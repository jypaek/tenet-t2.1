# Compiling
  "make" will generate two library files:
  - libtenet.a
  - armlibtenet.a
  - cpplibtenet.a


# Including the libarary

  Tenet application writer should:
  - include "tenet.h" in their application, and
  - include "libtenet.a" library file into compilation of their application.
    ("libtenet_arm.a" for arm processor)
    ("libtenet_cpp.a" for c++ compilation of your application)


# MEMO
  - The "construct_task()" function takes a task description string
    and composes a task description packet.
  - "element_usage.h" file has the printf files for showing how to use tasklets.
