XmastTree application makes all LEDS blink synchronously.

This application first verify if all the nodes in the network are synchronized.
If there is at least one node that is not synchronized, it will wait for it to synchronized.

When all nodes are synchronized, the application will task for nodes to blink in the same time.

Blink should be similar to CntToLeds behavior in TinyOs. Blinks should a value that is incremented every time.
The difference is that here all nodes do this synchronosly!

It is an application that is part of Tenet Distribution
