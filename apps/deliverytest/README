DESCRIPTION
===========

DeliveryTest tests the end-to-end packet delivery performance.
It is an application that is part of Tenet Distribution
( http://tenet.usc.edu )

This application tasks all motes to send 'N' packets with attributes
{sequence number, next-hop, hop-count, and master-address information},
at regular interval 'I', using transport protocol 'P'. 
When the application terminates, it shows reliability (packet delivery
ratio), goodput, list of used next-hops, hop-counts, and masters,
and how often each of them were used.

This Tenet application can be used to quickly test the reliability and 
the maximum packet rate that can be used on a deployed Tenet network
with various transport protocols.


HOWTO RUN
=========
  $./deliverytest -e [expected #nodes] -r [protocol] -i [interval]

where [protocol] = 0 for best-effort, 
                   1 for packet transport, and
                   2 for stream transport.


HELP MESSAGE
============
  $ ./deliverytest -h

==============
