/**
 * Header file for accessing MetaList data structure in TRD.
 * - This file provides the structures and the functions for a list of metadatas
 * - To use the MetaList, you must do the following.
 *   - Declare a MetaList:           "MetaList rlist;"
 *   - Declare MetaListEntry array:  "MetaListEntry entry[SIZE];"
 *   - Call initialization function:     "metalist_init(&rlist, entry, SIZE);"
 *   - This allocates(links) memory: "rlist->item = entry"
 * - We can make multiple instances of MetaLists using this method.
